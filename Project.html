        Hi! I'm <b>Indira Davis</b> and I enjoy writing. Here are some samples of short stories I wrote.<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>The Spider Infestation</u></b><br>
        <br>
        One day in the cafeteria, I was sitting at a table that was near the end of the room. I had finished eating my lunch and was ready to go, but I had to wait until lunch was over. I decided to take a nap to pass the time. Then, all of a sudden, I was awakened by screaming. Like a “My life is in danger” scream.<br>
        <br>

I sit up to see hundreds of spiders crawling out from underneath one of the tables. I get up and start running to the door. I guess others had the same idea because out of nowhere a group of people pushed me to the ground and trampled me. I started to feel the spiders start to crawl on me. I got up as fast as I could and ran, but I was too late.<br>
<br>
Both doors, that lead out of the cafeteria, were shut to keep the spiders in. And there I was, trapped inside a spider-infested room. There were three other girls trapped inside with me. Two of them were screaming and hugging each other. Well the other one, Kate, went to town on them. She used her mask to scoop the spiders up and then crush them, along with using her jacket to whack them back. I was in shock at the time though. Wondering “What is going on?” but I finally snapped out of it when the spiders started to crawl on the girls who were screaming. Their screams got even louder and they jumped behind me, still screaming by the way! They were so close that they were basically screaming in my ear. Once I realized what was happening, I pushed the girl off of me, and I started to help Kate.<br>

<b><u>Christmas is Overatted.</u></b><br>

Tis was the first of November and I was terribly hungry. But I had no food in the fridge. But fear I shall not! For I have a job and a not so good income… Now, my chariot awaits!<br>
<br>
I dashed down the halls, grabbed my keys, burst through the door, and got into my car. I arrived at Walmart and walked in to find… all of the normal products that are usually on display. But then I heard something. Something I thought I wouldn’t hear just yet. Bells ringing, but not just any bells. They were playing a jolly tune. Then, I heard it. <i>“OooooooOoooOOOOOOOOOOOOO”</i> No… no, no, no, No, No, NO, NO, NO, NO, OH NO! WHY! <i>“aLl I wAnT fOr ChRiStMaS iS…”</i> NO! DON’T YOU DARE!<br>
<br>
<i>“YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU”</i> OH GOD WHY!? I ran off only to find Christmas decorations all around me! Stockings, grinder bread houses, decorated trees, an inflatable Santa and the grinch! WHAT THE HELL MAN! IT’S LITERALLY THE FIRST DAY OF NOVEMBER! BUNK THIS, I’M OUT! So, I ran but… I saw something that will scar me forever. It was the grinch dancing to Christmas music. “AHHHHHHHHH!” I screamed as I fell to the ground in horror. My eyes, burning, my face, mortified, my mental state, destroyed. All of my regrets flashed before my eyes as I ran back to my car. Never again.<br>
<br>
“<i>Sigh</i>, there goes another one.” an employee said in a very depressed tone.<br>
Those are some of my stories.
